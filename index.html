            Attack on Titan
          </h2>
          <p>
            The story of the Titans begins over 1800 years before the
            aforementioned premiere is set. The first Titan, a young girl named
            Ymir, once lived a provincial life in a small village. Everything
            changed when a warrior tribe called the Eldians attacked. The
            villagers were either killed or enslaved; Ymir was one of the
            "lucky" latter ones.

            "Attack on Titan" is a popular Japanese manga and anime series
            created by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity is on
            the brink of extinction due to the existence of giant humanoid
            creatures called Titans. The story revolves around a young boy named
            Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend
            Armin Arlert. The series begins with the sudden appearance of
            Titans, who breach the massive walls that protect the last remnants
            of humanity. In the face of this catastrophic event, Eren, Mikasa,
            and Armin join the military to fight against the Titans and reclaim
            their lost territories. As the story progresses, the trio faces
            numerous challenges, battles, and encounters with both Titans and
            human adversaries. They uncover dark secrets about the true nature
            of the Titans, the history of their world, and the government's
            hidden agenda. The series explores themes of survival, sacrifice,
            political corruption, and the nature of humanity.
